### Introduction

This folder contains the assignment files required by [Assignment 05](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/evaluation/hw05/hw05/) for the 2019 offering of the course STAT 545 at the University of British Columbia.

The goal of this assignment is copied here from the assignment page for those unfamiliar with the course.

> Goals:
> 
> * Write some data to file and load it back into R.
> * Explain the value of the here::here package
> * Improve a figure (or make one from scratch), using new knowledge, e.g., control the color scheme, use factor levels, smoother mechanics.
> * Reorder a factor in a principled way based on the data and demonstrate the effect in arranged data and in figures.
> * Implement visualization design principles.
>
> The goal of this homework is to get you thinking about data portability, collaboration, and dissemination of your work more widely. You will learn to import and export your datasets and also practice effective plotting principles.

We primarily use the `tidyverse` R package to complete the assignment tasks.
